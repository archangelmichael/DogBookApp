DogBook
DogBook is an online mating networking service. It enables dogs or their owners to find the perfect mating match for them by sharing status updates, personal photos and private messages. DogBook allows any dog looking for a partner to become a registered user of the website.
After registering users can create a User profile, add other users as "friends", exchange messages, post status updates and photos, share videos and receive notifications when others update their profiles. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by breed, competitions or owners, and categorize their friends into lists such as "Dogs For Walks" or "Mating Dogs". DogBook gives dogs the unique opportunity to meet a lifetime partner or just have fun with friends and socialize.
